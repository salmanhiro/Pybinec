# Pybinec (Python for Binary Eclipsing)

This is a python code for determining eclipsing binary star astrophysical properties, such as:
1. Star radius 
2. Star half semi-major axis length
3. Star mass
4. Star temperature ratio (in development)

To use this program, we need basic physical parameters derived from observation, simplified to:
1. Radial velocity of stars
2. Total contact time of eclipse
3. Total eclipse length
4. Magnitude changed in primary and secondary eclipses
5. Binary star period

To use this program, just `import pybinec`

## Modules
In progress, stay tuned, or if you're hungry, just look at `pybinec.py`

For general use, pybinec has some modules

This program was far from ideal eclipsing binary star astrophysical properties determination, and currently functioned as learning media for students. We are open for development, just hit the Pull Request, send your code, I will test it, and Welcome to our team!

This program was made by a lonely astrophysics undergrad student, so I will be welcome for any conversation!
